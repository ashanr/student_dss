- Geographic distribution covers 20 source countries

### Consistency
- Logical relationships maintained (acceptances â‰¤ applications)
- Score ranges properly bounded (1-10 scales)
- Dates and numerical values within realistic ranges

### Realism
- Based on empirical research on student migration factors
- Correlation patterns match academic literature
- Distribution patterns reflect real-world scenarios

## Research Applications

### Academic Research
- Student migration pattern analysis
- Decision-making behavior studies
- Cross-cultural education research
- Policy impact assessment

### Industry Applications

- Behavioral pattern recognition

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Limitations
- Synthetic data based on research patterns
- Point-in-time snapshot (no longitudinal tracking)
- Cultural nuances simplified
- Economic factors may not reflect current conditions

### Ethical Considerations
- Privacy protection in real implementations
- Bias prevention in predictive models
- Fair representation across demographics
- Transparency in decision-making algorithms

### Future Enhancements
