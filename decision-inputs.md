## 7. Decision Criteria Weights
Users can adjust the relative importance (weight) of various decision factors:
- Cost of Living: 0-50% weight
- Tuition Fees: 0-50% weight 
- University Ranking: 0-50% weight
- Language Barrier: 0-50% weight
- Visa Processing Ease: 0-50% weight
- Job Prospects: 0-50% weight

## Algorithmic Processing
The system uses a Simple Additive Weighting (SAW) algorithm to:
1. Normalize all criteria values (cost criteria are inversely normalized)
2. Apply user-defined weights to each criterion
3. Calculate a total score for each destination
4. Rank destinations by their scores

## Data Sources
Recommendations are generated by matching user inputs against:
- Country data (cost of living, visa policies, language, etc.)
- University data (rankings, programs, tuition fees)
- Program-specific data (duration, specializations, requirements)
- Employment statistics for graduates
- Visa and immigration policies
- Student satisfaction data
